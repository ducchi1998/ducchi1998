- My life: 
"The sad thing is that I'm different from everyone else. I lost my hearing (right ear) in 1st grade, how badly it changed me.Next year in college I started to lose hearing (left ear) but fortunately not completely deaf. But now I have to use a hearing aid to hear. I no longer hear as well as before, which makes me very nervous in communication. But I'm still trying to get through this which can be difficult but I'll try to listen to what people have to say."
- Thank you for watching and caring. Wishing you a day full of luck and success in your work.
